* load the `dist/` directory via "Load unpacked" on `chrome://extensions/` - don't forget you have to have "Developer mode: ON". You can also download a `zip` of the most recent build [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7km45gk6nngrvxm/dist.zip?dl=1).

## Feedback
I'm actively working on the code, and will aim to tidy things up considerably. Feel free to open an issue or a PR, or just email me.
